            <h2><span id="style">About Me</span></h2>
            <p>When the other kids were watching the Rugrats, I was watching Julia Child and Todd English! I've always
                been drawn to the kitchen - probably because my Greek-American household always revolved around food (in
                the best way possible!). I learned how to cook by watching my parents and grandparents, helping whenever
                they let me. As I got older, I started watching as many cooking videos as I could find, following food
                bloggers, and collecting beautiful cookbooks. When I started posting pictures of my own creations on
                Instagram, my friends would beg me for recipes, but I never had them because I just made things up on
                the fly and never wrote them down. After someone didn't know my name and called, "Hey, foodie girl!" to
                get my attention, I knew it was time to do something to develop my passion for cooking. After launching
                @heyfoodiegirl on Instagram last year, I was overwhelmed by the positive feedback and support I
                received. Eventually, I grew tired of squeezing recipes into Instagram captions and decided to take my
                creative outlet in a new direction. Welcome to Hey Foodie Girl, the blog!</p>
